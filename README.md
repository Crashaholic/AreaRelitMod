## Description
A simple relighting mod that I made just to learn the ropes of making a mod. All this mod does is adjust the color values of the lights in the currently loaded scene.

## Usage

|Button | Action|
|--|--|
|F6| Opens the Lighting Panel|

## Lighting Panel
The Lighting Panel will show the name of the current scene as well as buttons to adjust ***all*** the lights in the scene. Each button will add or subtract (10 / 255) to the respective Red, Green or Blue channel color of the lights.
There is also a button to subtract from all lights as well, to quickly make a scene darker.
